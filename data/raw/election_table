<td colspan="3">
<p>For the first time since adopting their respective systems, both Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maine distributes its electoral votes proportionally, with two at-large electors representing the statewide winning presidential and vice presidential candidates and one elector each representing the winners from its two Congressional districts. For only the second time since adopting this system, Maine's four electoral votes were split between the two major party tickets.<br/>
             </li>
<li>Nebraska distributes its electoral votes proportionally, with two at-large electors representing the statewide winning presidential and vice presidential candidates and one elector each representing the winners from its three Congressional districts. For only the second time since adopting this system, Nebraska's five electoral votes were split between the two major party tickets. </li>
</ul>
<p>During the electoral vote count, objections were filed with respect to the Arizona and Pennsylvania electoral votes, but neither House sustained the objection, so all votes were counted.</p>
<p>Due to violent unrest in and around the Capitol, the electoral results were not certified until 3:44 a.m., the morning of January 7, 2021.</p>
